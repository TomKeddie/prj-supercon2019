# Mechanical designs for Hackaday 2019 Badge

## Badge Plate

This plate was designed to go underneath the board.  It has battery holes, it's not clear if they're big enough.
The openscad source and a dxf file for laser cutting are included.  Use thick acrylic as the pieces around the battery are thin.
It is designed to sit on a table with rubber feet under it.  It could be adapted to cover the front with button holes if
being handheld was preferred.  I have no badge it is untested.

The mounting posts are TCEHCBS-12-01 available at [Digikey](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/TCEHCBS-12-01/RPC1447-ND/395461).

## Badge Plate 18650

My intention is to remove the AA battery holders and replace them with a pair of 18650 batteries and a buck converter to produce 3V.  Clearance with the connectors and diodes is tight.  This design has not ben tested.

The mounting posts are TCEHCBS-14-01 available at [Digikey](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/TCEHCBS-14-01/RPC1448-ND/395462).
