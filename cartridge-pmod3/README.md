# Unofficial KiCad template for a 2019 Hackaday Superconference Badge Cartridge

This template can be used as a starting point to make a cartridge for the Supercon badge, that will mate with the 40 pin expansion connector on the back of the badge.

It's using an angled 2x20 pin male header, a w25q128 SPI flash and a 100nF cap. The schematic has the pins named using global nets, so it's easy to simply add in your own stuff.
